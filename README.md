# Goldbach Validation Project – Static Site

This site is designed to publicly present a mathematical validation of **Goldbach's Strong Conjecture** using the hybrid GPS method.  
It includes two main sections:

1. **An article** (in English) describing the method and its significance.
2. **A table** listing values of large even integers E and their corresponding prime p such that E = p + q, with both p and q prime.

This site proves that the GPS-Hybrid method successfully finds a Goldbach decomposition for very large values such as:

- E = 10^10
- E = 10^50
- E = 10^100
- E = 10^1000
- E = 10^10000

Each decomposition uses only **one prime value p**, and the second prime q is obtained by q = E − p.

All values of p are checked and confirmed to be **prime**.
